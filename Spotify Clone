# Spotify-Clone
I have made this project with the help of HTML, CSS , JavaScript and Font Awesome.
In this project i have inserted 14 songs and on each songs i have inserted a play and pause button 
such that whenever user want to play the music to listen the songs 
and whenever user wants to pause the songs then the songs will paused
At the bottom of the web page i have inserted a bottom bar and on that
bottom bar i have inserted three button , one is for previous button , second button
for pause and play the music and last button i.e third button which is next button 
The functionalities of these three button at the bottom bar i.e previous button, pause and play 
button and next button is that "previous button" is for playing previous songs and pause and play
button for stop and play the music whenever user wants to pause and play the music on the bottom bar.
Another functionalities that i have inserted that is when to click on the play button and pause button
a playing gif will be come into an animation. So that's all about my Spotify Clone Project.
